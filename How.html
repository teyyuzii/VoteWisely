            <h1> Steps to ensure an informed decision before voting:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li> Learn about the candidates, the government offices they are running for, and any other key issues in the election because if you find too much information, one way to start is with an issue you care about (education, jobs, healthcare etc.) Wisely casting a vote requires understanding not just the personalities but also the long term implications of the electoral outcomes</li>
                <li> Think and analyze the information to ensure that why is the candidate running for office? What information do i need to decide if he/she is qualified for the position? How will this candidate put their values into action? </li>
                <li> When evaluating candidates are their experience, qualifications they are an incumbent or have held elected office before, what their voting record was because deciding which candidate to vote for is not simply a checklist and many candidates will have some characteristics that bolster their position.</li>
                <li> Getting a clear idea of each candidates personal character and integrity is a huge factor when your vote is on the line as well. Such as how they conducted their campaign - positive, negative if this is the person you want representing you in public office.</li>

            <p>How to Spot False Information</p></br>
                <p>Facebook released the below tips on how to spot false news online, in partnership with The News Literacy Project, The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, and Stony Brook University School of Journalism.</p> </br>
                
                Be skeptical of headlines. False news stories often have catchy headlines in all caps with exclamation points. If shocking claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.
                Look closely at the link. A phony or look-alike link may be a warning sign of false news. Many false news sites mimic authentic news sources by making small changes to the link. You can go to the site to compare the link to established sources.
                Investigate the source. Ensure that the story is written by a source that you trust with a reputation for accuracy. If the story comes from an unfamiliar organization, check their "About" section to learn more.
                Watch for unusual formatting. Many false news sites have misspellings or awkward layouts. Read carefully if you see these signs. Consider the photos. False news stories often contain manipulated images or videos. Sometimes the photo may be authentic, but taken out of context. You can search for the photo or image to verify where it came from.
                Inspect the dates. False news stories may contain timelines that make no sense, or event dates that have been altered. Check the evidence. Check the author's sources to confirm that they are accurate. Lack of evidence or reliance on unnamed experts may indicate a false news story.
                Look at other reports. If no other news source is reporting the same story, it may indicate that the story is false. If the story is reported by multiple sources you trust, it's more likely to be true.
                Is the story a joke? Sometimes false news stories can be hard to distinguish from humor or satire. Check whether the source is known for parody, and whether the story's details and tone suggest it may be just for fun.
                Some stories are intentionally false. Think critically about the stories you read, and only share news that you know to be credible.
